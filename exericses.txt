1. Write a C program that displays a rectangle, built from the letters x,  with widht = 10 and height = 6:
xxxxxxxxxx
x        x
x        x
x        x
x        x
xxxxxxxxxx

2. Write a program that takes an integer value from the keyboard and returns the number with its digits reversed. 
For example, given the number 7631, the program should return 1367.

3. Convert the program from exercise 1 in a function that takes the widht and height as parameters. 
Call that function from the main program. 

4.  Indicate in red the code lines that are syntactically incorrect. Indicate in green the expressions that are     
    syntactically correct, but that are useless or might cause problems during execution.
    Finally, what will appear on the display? Do not use your computer. 

    int i,j;
    double d;
    int *ip = NULL, *jp = NULL;
    double *dp = NULL;
    i = 7;
    ip = &7;
    jp = &i;
    *jp = j;
    *ip = i;
    ip = &j;
    &i = ip;
    j=4;
    (*ip)++;
    &d = dp;
    *ip*= i;
    *jp=*&j;
    ip++;
    i = ip-&i;
    dp = &i;
    dp = ip;
    &dp = &&d;
    *ip+=1;
    *ip++;
    cout <<endl<< i << j << d;
    printf("i = %d, j = %d",i, j);   
    printf("i = %d, j = %d",*ip, *jp);
